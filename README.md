# Alvin_Divina_Personal_Project

To run these test we are going to need 4 things. 
1. IntelliJ IDE with TestNG plugin
2. download Chrome
3. pull this code to your IDE
4. set it as a maven project then download dependencies.
5. right click testng.xml and run it. make sure to not change the thread count.

This automation is running successful parallel execution using Threadlocal method.

Added a thread safe extent report in the framework. It can log and take screenshots per commands in the reporter if implemented.

Ran the test back to back just to show how thread safe the threadlocal method is.
